# blackpool-cabs-shift-tracker

I have a taxi company and i need a website page which will record each shift. The operators in the office will imput data in the website which will show for example. How many drivers are on each hour, how many bookings done in that hour, and anything else you think would be good to record during the shift for the taxi company. I would like the GUI to look nice with also graphs and charts which show all data, so we can see growth or decline on the charts. There should be a date picker to select a date range, the data will remain captured so we can go back at any time to review. The company is called Blackpool Cabs so many add this at the top.
